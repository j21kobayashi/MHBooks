    "#### 「人狼」ゲームのシミュレーション\n",
    "-  「人狼」ゲームには多数の変形版が存在するが，ここでは役割の数が最低限である単純なものを想定する。\n",
    "   - プレイヤーの総数は9人とする。\n",
    "   - このうち，人狼が2人，占い師が1人，残りが村人となる場合に，「村人+占い師」チームと「人狼」チームのそれぞれの勝利の確率がおおよそ等しくなることを以下のシミュレーションによって示す。\n",
    "- プレイヤーへの役割の振り分けは，一様分布に従う確率変数によって行う。\n",
    "  - 役割が3種類あるので，ありうる全ての役割の振り分けのパターン (下記の `role_patterns`) は，多項組合せで表現される。\n",
    "  - 一様分布に従う確率変数による振り分けでは，各パターンがどれも等しい確率で発生しうることになる\n",
    "- 以下のシミュレーションにおいては，「襲撃」でも「処刑」でも一様分布に従う確率変数によって対象を選択する。"
